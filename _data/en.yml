        title: Equa helps reduce your costs
        image: /assets/my/images/executive.jpg
        body: > 
          Transitioning from paper to digital for your communication with tenants
          will help you reduce your operating costs. 
          Sending a single message with Equa is equivalent to putting up many posters
          in your buildings, or sending many individual letters to tenants.

        body: >
          With Equa, you enter data only once.
          We integrate with your existing ERP system, and it periodically sends us an anonymized version of your real estate and tenant data.
          This way, you can start using our value-adding features right away.

          Equa also makes the lives of your tenants easier.
          The advent of smartphones has changed the consumers' expectations considerably. 
          Most of your tenants are used to organizing their lives on the internet using smartphones, 
          and Equa is a natural fit for them.

            The needs of tenants in a large sense is a big part of our focus. 
            Depending on tenant needs and requests, we will add new tenant-facing features.
            Some of those will possibly be unrelated to property management.

            our property manager customers can justifiably forward the cost of Equa to their tenants.
