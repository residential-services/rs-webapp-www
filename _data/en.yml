        body: > 
          Transitioning from paper to digital for your communication with tenants
          will help you reduce your operating costs. 
          Sending a single message with Equa is equivalent to putting up many posters
          in your buildings, or sending many individual letters to tenants.

          Equa also makes the lives of your tenants easier.
          The advent of smartphones has changed the consumers' expectations considerably. 
          Most of your tenants are used to organizing their lives on the internet using smartphones, 
          and Equa is a natural fit for them.

        Unless you were hiding under a rock, you have probably heard of the proptech movement that is 
        bringing about a whole new generation of technology startups to the sector.
        Within this market, we are addressing a segment that is still being under-served. 
        Namely, households that live in average to low-end residential buildings.
        While there are some proptech companies that are already providing comparable online services
        to high-end constructions, we have chosen the path of disruptive innovation.
