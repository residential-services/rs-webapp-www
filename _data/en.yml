        image: /assets/my/images/360x240/gbaf030518-33-1-360x240.jpg
        body: > 
          Transitioning from paper to digital for your communication with tenants
          will help you reduce your operating costs. 
          Sending a single message with Equa is equivalent to putting up many posters
          in your buildings, or sending many individual letters to tenants.

          Equa also makes the lives of your tenants easier.
          The advent of smartphones has changed the consumers' expectations considerably. 
          Most of your tenants are used to organizing their lives on the internet using smartphones, 
          and Equa is a natural fit for them.

            Our service fee is based on the number of households that are Equa users during the current billing period.
            For households that you have added or removed during this period, a reduced price will apply that depends on the
            number of days of activity.
            For example, if your ERP system tells us that a new tenant will be moving in 10 days before the end of a billing period, 
            then you will be charged 10 times the daily fee for that user for that period, or CHF (6/30)*10 = CHF 2.-.

            In this case, we will take care of properly installing and configuring the connector. This software is available for macOS and Windows.

        Unless you were hiding under a rock, you have probably heard of the proptech movement that is 
        bringing about a whole new generation of technology startups to the sector.
        Within this market, we are addressing a segment that is still being under-served. 
        Namely, households that live in average to low-end residential buildings.
        While there are some proptech companies that are already providing comparable online services
        to high-end constructions, we have chosen the path of disruptive innovation.
