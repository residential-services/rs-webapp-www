        body: > 
          Transitioning from paper to digital for your communication with tenants
          will help you reduce your operating costs. 
          Sending a single message with Equa is equivalent to putting up many posters
          in your buildings, or sending many individual letters to tenants.

          Equa also makes the lives of your tenants easier.
          The advent of smartphones has changed the consumers' expectations considerably. 
          Most of your tenants are used to organizing their lives on the internet using smartphones, 
          and Equa is a natural fit for them.

            Our monthly service fee is based on the number of users each day of the month. 
            For example, if a thousand of your households are Equa users on an average day, 
            then our monthly fee will amount to CHF ((6/30)*1000)*30 or CHF 6K.
            This provides you with the latitude of adding and removing households
            any time you wish.

            If your ERP system lacks built-in Equa compatibility, then a connector is needed for integrating your ERP system with Equa.
            In this case, we will take care of properly installing and configuring the connector. This software is available for macOS and Windows.
