          Make the lives of your residents easier by offering them the Equa Phi app.
          Most of your residents are used to organizing their lives on the Internet using smartphones, 
          and Equa Phi is a natural fit for them. We plan to include features in Equa Phi that go beyond
          resident relations, and that are nevertheless useful for residents. 
          Examples: the reservation of shared facilities such as laundry rooms, community features such as pin boards, and easy access to local consumer businesses.
